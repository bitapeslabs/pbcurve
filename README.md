## Build & publish

The npm package ships both the TypeScript wrapper (`dist`) and the wasm-bindgen
artifacts generated by `wasm-pack` (`native/pkg`).  

- Run `npm run build` to produce both outputs locally.  
- `npm pack`/`npm publish` now trigger that build automatically through the
  `prepack` script, ensuring the `.wasm` blob and JS glue emitted by
  `wasm-pack` are always included in the tarball.  
- You can verify what will ship via `npm pack --dry-run` once the build
  completes.
